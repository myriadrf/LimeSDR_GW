PCIe and USB Interfacing
------------------------
The LimeSDR_GW framework supports two main high-speed host interfaces: PCI Express (PCIe) and USB
3.0. The interface choice depends on the board, required bandwidth, and host compatibility. PCIe
offers higher throughput for demanding streaming, while USB provides simpler integration and broader
accessibility.

+-------------------+------------------+-----------------------------+

USB Interface (FT601)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The LimeSDR Mini boards (V1 and V2) use the FTDI FT601 chip for USB 3.0 connectivity. This is
wrapped in a reusable LiteX USB core with multiple endpoints:

- Control/Status endpoints for configuration, monitoring, and command handling (e.g., GET_INFO,
  LMS_RST).
- Streaming endpoints for RX/TX I/Q data transfer via FIFO.

The core builds on the original LimeSDR USB HDL but fits seamlessly into LiteX's SoC, using CSRs
and Wishbone buses for communication. Firmware manages USB packet processing, FIFO reads/writes,
and host interactions.

**Boards using USB:**

- `LimeSDR Mini V1`
- `LimeSDR Mini V2`

PCIe Interface (LitePCIe)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The XTRX board uses PCI Express, based on the open-source `LitePCIe` core (at
https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litepcie). This enables:

- Memory-mapped (MMAP) access via BAR regions for register control and DMA setup.
- Streaming (DMA) for high-speed RX/TX I/Q data.
- Interrupt support.

LitePCIe integrates closely with LiteX's SoC, including tools for auto-generating Linux drivers.
Firmware handles PCIe command processing, and MMAP interactions.

**Board using PCIe:**

- `LimeSDR XTRX`

Testing and Debugging Interfaces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**For USB (FT601):**

- *Basic Functionality:* Use **LimeSuiteGUI** to detect the board and read/write control/status
  registers.
- *Streaming Test:* Run **LimeSuite** CLI (e.g., `LimeQuickTest`) or GNU Radio with `gr-limesdr`
  for RX/TX validation.
- *Firmware Validation:* Check Control/Status endpoints for proper packet handling (e.g., via USB
  analyzers or logs).

**For PCIe (LitePCIe):**

- *MMAP/DMA Test:* Use **LitePCIe utilities** like `litepcie_util`, `litepcie_dma_test`, and
  `litepcie_probe` for access and performance checks.

**Generic Debugging Tool:**

- *LiteScope:* Integrate this logic analyzer into the SoC to monitor USB/PCIe signals in the FPGA,
  useful for FSMs, stalls, or behaviors. For details on adding a host bridge to enable LiteScope
  communication, see the LiteX Wiki page on `Use Host Bridge to control debug a SoC
  <https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex/wiki/Use-Host-Bridge-to-control-debug-a-SoC>`_. For
  instructions on integrating and using LiteScope itself, see the LiteX Wiki page on `Use LiteScope
  To Debug A SoC <https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex/wiki/Use-LiteScope-To-Debug-A-SoC>`_.

Tip: Use LiteX BIOS for initial MMAP register checks before higher-level tools.

Toolchains
----------
This section offers a detailed overview of the FPGA synthesis toolchains used for supported boards
in the LimeSDR_GW project, ensuring reproducibility and helping new developers set up environments.
It also covers the RISC-V firmware toolchain, which LiteX can install automatically for convenience.

FPGA Synthesis Toolchains
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Different synthesis tools are used based on the FPGA vendor and family:

+-------------------+------------------+-----------------------------+
| Board             | FPGA             | Toolchain                   |
+===================+==================+=============================+
| LimeSDR Mini V1   | Altera MAX10     | Intel Quartus Prime Lite    |
+-------------------+------------------+-----------------------------+
| LimeSDR Mini V2   | Lattice ECP5     | Yosys + nextpnr-ecp5        |
+-------------------+------------------+-----------------------------+
| XTRX              | Xilinx Artix-7   | Xilinx Vivado               |
+-------------------+------------------+-----------------------------+

Notes:

- For **Intel MAX10**, Intel Quartus Prime Lite Edition is sufficient (Quartus Pro is not required).
- For **Lattice ECP5**, the open-source Yosys/nextpnr-ecp5 toolchain is employed.
- For **Xilinx Artix-7**, Xilinx Vivado (WebPACK or Standard edition) is required.

The LiteX build system automatically detects the board and selects the appropriate toolchain,
generating project files, constraints, and build scripts tailored to the vendor.

RISC-V Firmware Toolchains
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For soft RISC-V CPUs (e.g., VexRiscv or PicoRV32), a RISC-V toolchain compiles the firmware (BIOS or
application). LiteX simplifies installation and management:

The recommended toolchain is **riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc** with newlib (no OS), targeting `rv32im` or
`rv32ima` based on CPU features.

Installation:

Use LiteX's setup script for automatic installation:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./litex_setup.py init install --toolchain riscv

LiteX handles firmware compilation, linker scripts, and Board Support Packages (BSPs) for the
selected CPU, embedding the binary into the FPGA bitstream. Override defaults with `--riscv-cpu` and
`--cpu-variant` options if needed.

Gateware Update Mechanism
--------------------------
.. figure:: images/flash_update.png
   :align: center
   :width: 600
   :alt: Flash Update

This section describes the process for updating the FPGA gateware (bitstream). Updates focus on
flashing the bitstream to non-volatile storage (Flash), enabling the FPGA to load it automatically
on power-up. The soft CPU firmware handles update commands from the host, with LimeSuite as the
primary tool for managing the process on the host side.

Overview
^^^^^^^^
Firmware updates use the host interfaces (USB or PCIe) to transfer bitstream data to the soft CPU
firmware, which then manages writing to Flash. This ensures updates are persistent and reduces the
need for volatile loads. Key concepts include:

- **Firmware Role**: The soft CPU (e.g., VexRiscv) acts as an intermediary, processing host commands
  to erase Flash sectors, program pages, and handle data integrity.
- **LimeSuite Communication**: The host tool (LimeSuite) initiates updates, sending commands and
  bitstream data in segments over the interface, with firmware responding with statuses (e.g.,
  success or error).
- **Multiboot Support**: Allows multiple bitstream images in Flash (e.g., a reliable "golden" image
  and an update image), with automatic fallback on failure for recovery.
- **Portability**: LiteX abstracts Flash access (via LiteSPI), making the mechanism consistent
  across boards and FPGA vendors.

This approach minimizes risks during updates and supports shared firmware across all LimeSDR
variants.

Update Process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Updates are typically performed using LimeSuite (e.g., via `LimeUtil --update` or GUI features):

- LimeSuite connects to the board over USB/PCIe and sends update commands along with bitstream data
  in segments.
- The firmware receives these via control endpoints, validates the data, erases relevant Flash
  areas, and writes the bitstream.
- Additional handling for non-volatile data like VCTCXO DAC values or serial numbers, stored in
  specific Flash offsets.

For USB-based boards (Mini V1/V2), this uses FT601; for PCIe (XTRX), it leverages LitePCIe.

Multiboot Across FPGAs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Multiboot enables safe updates by supporting multiple images in Flash:

- Store a golden image at the base address and updates at an offset.
- On power-up, the FPGA loads the primary image; if it fails (e.g., due to corruption), it falls
  back to the golden one automatically.
- Vendor differences (e.g., Intel MAX10 uses CFM partitions, Lattice ECP5 uses configuration
  registers, Xilinx Artix-7 uses ICAP) are handled transparently, with firmware setting boot flags
  or addresses.

This provides robustness, especially for remote or field updates.

Testing and Recovery
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Post-update verification via LimeSuite (e.g., check firmware version or run diagnostics like
  LimeQuickTest).
- If issues arise, multiboot falls back to the golden image; JTAG serves as a last-resort recovery.
- Use tools like LiteScope for debugging Flash interactions during development.
